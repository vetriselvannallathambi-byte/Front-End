        Communication is the process of sharing ideas, thoughts, and feelings between individuals to create understanding and build relationships. It plays a vital role in our daily lives, whether through spoken words, written messages, body language, or digital media. Effective communication helps people express their needs clearly, resolve conflicts peacefully, and work together toward common goals. It also strengthens personal and professional relationships by promoting trust and cooperation.
